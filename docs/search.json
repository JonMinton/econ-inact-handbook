    "text": "Advantages and Disadvantages\nUsing commit mode on Package Manager to host an R package makes it easier for maintainers as they do not have to worry so much about how to version every update. The package maintainers would have to ensure (as far as possible) that only stable commits are made on the main branch. However, the disadvantage is that version history may be long (particularly if a number of small commits have been made) and storage space on the infrastructure used to host Package Manager is needed to store all source files. For example, phstemplates on Package Manager has a version created for every commit to the main branch:\nVERSION\n1.2.1.0.0.0.1719407970\n\nARCHIVED VERSIONS\n1.2.1.0.0.0.1718379552\nJun 14, 2024 3:39 PM UTC\n1.2.0.0.0.0.1707843561\nFeb 13, 2024 4:59 PM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1705940511\nJan 22, 2024 4:21 PM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1704882475\nJan 10, 2024 10:27 AM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1700760626\nNov 23, 2023 5:30 PM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1700647485\nNov 22, 2023 10:04 AM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1699616873\nNov 10, 2023 11:47 AM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1699351034\nNov 7, 2023 9:57 AM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1698952735\nNov 2, 2023 7:18 PM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1698157806\nOct 24, 2023 2:30 PM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1698053868\nOct 23, 2023 9:37 AM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1696581278\nOct 6, 2023 8:34 AM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1696322496\nOct 3, 2023 8:41 AM UTC\n1.1.1.0.0.0.1696251514\nOct 2, 2023 12:58 PM UTC\n1.1.0.0.0.0.1695820271\nSep 27, 2023 1:11 PM UTC\n1.1.0.0.0.0.1695805326\nSep 27, 2023 9:02 AM UTC\n1.1.0.0.0.0.1695735559\nSep 26, 2023 1:39 PM UTC\n1.1.0.0.0.0.1695658190\nSep 25, 2023 4:09 PM UTC\n1.1.0.0.0.0.1695206490\nSep 20, 2023 10:41 AM UTC\n1.1.0.0.0.0.1689262223\nJul 13, 2023 3:30 PM UTC\n1.1.0.0.0.0.1661965078\nAug 31, 2022 4:57 PM UTC\nAnother drawback with commit mode is that you would have to look at the commit history on Github to see exactly what changes were made for each of these versions. If a major bug was introduced at some point in the commit history, it could be challenging for a user to find and install the most recent stable version.\nTags mode requires more administrative work by maintainers of R packages (as an extra step is needed to associate commits with tags and to push these tags to Github) but should result in a cleaner version history on Package Manager. The deliberate tagging process should mean we get only a list of stable releases and changes in each version should have been clearly documented in news.md.\nIf Package Manager were to use tags mode for phstemplates, we would have only the latest v1.2.1 and three previous archived versions available, resulting in a lot fewer archived versions compared with commits mode.\n$ git tag\nv1.0.0\nv1.1.0\nv1.2.0\nv1.2.1\nThe benefit for users would be that it would be easier to install previous versions of a package if needed (for example, if the latest version introduced a bug). There should also be less versions created on Package Manager which would save some storage space on the infrastructure. Furthermore, these tags can be reviewed periodically and redundant versions can be deleted if desired."
