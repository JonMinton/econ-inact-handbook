To set up this project in the way expected by the package functions:

-   Register with the [UK Data Archive](https://www.data-archive.ac.uk/)
-   Find and download the **stata** version of [Study ID 6614](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6614), Understanding Society: Waves 1-13, 2009-2022 and Harmonised BHPS: Waves 1-18, 1991-2009
    -   This is the publicly accessible version of the UKHLS, in which fields have been harmonised between waves, and which also includes records from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which is the predecessor to Understanding Society
-   Unzip the above file into the location `big_data` within this folder. Within this folder, make sure the unzipped data are within the folder `UKDA-6614-stata`.
    -   Within `UKDA-6615-stata`, there should be the following files and folders:
        -   `6614_file_information.rtf`
        -   `read6614.htm`
        -   `mrdoc`, containing further documentation
        -   `stata`, containing the data files themselves
-   Once the data files are in the appropriate relative location, open up the RStudio project by double clicking on the `economic_inactivity.rproj` file, or selecting the project from within RStudio
-   To load the package, while within RStudio, run `devtools::load_all(".")` in the console. If devtools is installed correctly, you should also be able to run the above with the keyboard shortcut `SHIFT + cmd/cntrl + L`
